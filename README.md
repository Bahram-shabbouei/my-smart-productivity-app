My Smart Productivity App
Welcome to the My Smart Productivity App, a modern, AI-powered productivity assistant. This project was developed as my final project for the "Web Development & Cloud Computing" course at Techstarter. The application is built entirely on serverless principles, leveraging the power and scalability of Microsoft Azure.

Project Overview
This serverless web application is designed to help users manage their tasks and notes with integrated, intelligent features. The application's architecture is split into a front-end UI and a back-end API, communicating seamlessly to provide a fast and responsive user experience.

Core Technologies
The project is built using a robust serverless stack:

Frontend: React 18 (Create React App) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

Backend: Azure Functions (Node.js v4) - A serverless compute service that allows you to run event-triggered code without provisioning or managing infrastructure.

Database: Azure Cosmos DB (SQL API) - A globally distributed, multi-model database service that provides high-speed data access.

Deployment: Azure Static Web Apps - A service that automatically builds and deploys full-stack web apps from a GitHub repository.

Local Development: Azure Static Web Apps CLI - A local development server that emulates the behavior of Azure Static Web Apps.

Continuous Deployment: GitHub Actions - Automates the build and deployment pipeline whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

Features
Task Management: Create, edit, and delete tasks with due dates and categories.

Statistics Dashboard: Visualize your productivity with a dashboard that shows task completion rates and category breakdowns.

AI Integration: (Optional/Future) - Planned features may include intelligent reminders or task prioritization based on user behavior.

Dark Mode: A simple toggle for a more comfortable viewing experience.

Notification System: Receive reminders for upcoming task deadlines.

Local Development
To run the project locally, you need to have Node.js and npm installed. The project's local dependencies are managed to ensure a smooth setup.

Prerequisites
Node.js (version 18 or later)

Azure Static Web Apps CLI (will be installed automatically via npm run dev)

Azure Functions Core Tools (will be installed automatically via npm run dev)

Azure Cosmos DB Emulator - For local database emulation.

Setup and Run
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone https://github.com/Bahram-shabbouei/my-smart-productivity-app.git
cd my-smart-productivity-app
Install Dependencies:
The project uses a simple script to install all dependencies for both the front-end and back-end.

Bash

npm run install:all
Run the Project Locally:
Start the Azure Static Web Apps CLI, which will run both the client and the API, and connect to your local Cosmos DB Emulator.

Bash

npm run dev
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:4280.

Deployment
The project is configured for automated deployment to Azure Static Web Apps via GitHub Actions. Any push to the main branch will trigger a workflow that builds the application and deploys it to your live Azure environment.

Project Structure
/client: Contains the React front-end application.

/api: Contains the Azure Functions backend code.

/.github/workflows/: Contains the GitHub Actions workflow file for CI/CD.

Enjoy the app!
